Hi, I'm Sriram Krishnaswamy and I'm a PhD student at the [Mechanical and Aerospace Department](https://mae.osu.edu), [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu). I joined here for Fall 2016, moving from [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu), where I did my Masters. I finished my undergraduate studies in India at [BITS, Pilani - Hyderabad Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/).

I maintain this blog to post the codes and notes that I take as part of the [Practical Javascript course](http://watchandcode.com/courses/practical-javascript) at [Watch and code](https://watchandcode.com). If you are interested to know more about me and what I do, you can check out my visual resume of sorts [here](http://sriramkswamy.github.io).
