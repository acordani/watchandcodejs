This is the source of a [Hexo](https://hexo.io) site that follows the [Practical Javascript course](http://watchandcode.com/courses/practical-javascript) at [Watch and code](https://watchandcode.com).

## About this repository

This repository contains two branches - `master` and `gh-pages`. `master` branch contains the source code for the blog posts while `gh-pages` is used to generate the blog using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). I have ignored the output of the blog that goes into the `public` directory while tracking `master` branch. The output can be found in the `gh-pages` branch.

## Contributing

If you feel there is only a minor error, [raise and issue](https://github.com/sriramkswamy/watchandcodejs/issues).

To add content, fork the repo, follow the style in previous blog posts and submit a pull request. You must know how to Hexo, which is actually pretty easy, and also must have [Node JS REPL](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. All the code blocks are evaluated in a Node REPL.
